# SCHOOL_DATADASE
This tool makes it simple for schools to save and manage teacher and student records.
Our goal is to create a database platform that allows users to easily save and alter data using a simple graphical user interface.
There are three main login options in the program:                      
1)	Administrator. 
2)	Teacher.
3)	Student.

1) The admin has the authority to create student and instructor profiles, fill them out with the relevant data, and assign classes to teachers and students. additionally edit or remove the profiles. 
2) A teacher can upload a student's exam mark list and correct it if there are any errors.
3) Students can access their grades records that have been saved in the database
